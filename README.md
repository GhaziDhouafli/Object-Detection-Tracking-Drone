# Object-Detection & Tracking-Drone
In this project, I was able to detect and track objects using the Coco Dataset and Yolo Algorithm in the Airsim Simulator.

COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation.

YOLO is an abbreviation for the term 'You Only Look Once'. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine. It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment.
